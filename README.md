To complete this test, applicants are expected to spend one hour and completing the following:

1. Clone the repo and create your own repository (do not fork)
2. Add pagination such that each page would show 10 items per page rather than all items.
3. Allow one click navigation when viewing a single item to the next result, rather than forcing the use to close and open the next item.
4. Fix general issues and refactor with solid principles.
